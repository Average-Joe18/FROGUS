# FROGUS üê∏

Introducing FROGUS: an endless frog-hopping side scroller! 

Play as FROGUS the frog, a simple amphibian who just wants to travel to the other side of the river. Use Mouse or Touch controls to make FROGUS's jump toward a destination, with the angle and distance of touch/click determining FROGUS's speed and trajectory. 

But be careful! Timing and accuracy are key with these rapidly moving river logs! Make sure to avoid missing logs and falling into the river! Otherwise, FROGUS has to start all over!
